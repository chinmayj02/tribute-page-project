             and a staggering 50 billion audio and video streams, 
             the young artist from Bergen, Norway is nowhere near kicking his feet up anytime soon. 
             Alan Walker arrived on the music scene in late 2015 with his debut hit single Faded,
             garnering over a 1,3 billion Spotify streams and a massive 2,9 billion YouTube video views. 
             Being the 19th most-watched music video on YouTube, 
             the single also left him with a BRIT awards nomination for Song of the Year, 
             as well as a Norwegian Grammy win in the same category.
             After building a massive social-following and releasing a string of successful singles like Alone and Darkside,
             collaborating with artists like Ava Max, Noah Cyrus, Sia, Bruno Mars and Coldplay, the chart-topping debut album Different World arrived in late 2018,
             amassing over 3,2 billion streams on Spotify. While holding a pristine track record, Alan has played over 600 headlining shows and festivals to date, 
             including Coachella and Tomorrowland, in addition to selling out his worldwide arena tours Aviation Tour. 
             In 2021 Alan is upping the ante with astonishing new music and visuals, so buckle up,
             cause heâ€™s just getting started.
